How to use plugin contents
==========================

Plugin contents are not shown in Unreal projects by default. To view plugin content, you need to click on few semi-hidden buttons:


.. image:: images/plugin_contents.png
   :target: images/plugin_contents.png
   :alt: plugin contents screenshot


**Causion**
Changes you make in content folder are changes to binary files so be careful.
